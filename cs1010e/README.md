# Kattis Templates for CS1010E Students
Hello there! In this subdirectory of this repository you'll find templates 
and solutions for solving OpenKattis problems with I/O logic separated. 
These should be helpful to you to practise solving tutorial / assignment
problems which are often written in this fashion.

To get started, you can head to any of the subdirectories which are named
after the problem ID of the kattis problem.

Download the template file, named `problemId_template.py`. Then, you can
be on your way! The recommended solutions to the problem using the template
can be found in `problemId_solution.py`. 

Of course, I am also attempting these problems on my own. You can find my
solutions to the problems in Python, C, Java, JavaScript, Haskell
(and hopefully many more) in the root directory of this repository.

Best of luck!
